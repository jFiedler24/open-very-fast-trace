# Features

This document defines the high-level features for the Open Very Fast Trace (OVFT) library.

## feat~tag-parsing~1

**Title:** Parse requirement tags from source code files

**Description:** The system shall be able to parse requirement tags from various source code file formats including Rust (.rs), ATL (.atl), and ADL (.adl) files.

**Rationale:** This enables developers to embed traceability information directly in their source code, maintaining consistency between implementation and requirements.

**Tags:** parsing, source-code, traceability

**Needs:** req, dsn

---

## feat~markdown-parsing~1

**Title:** Parse requirements from markdown files

**Description:** The system shall be able to parse requirement specifications from markdown files using OpenFastTrace-compatible syntax.

**Rationale:** Markdown provides a human-readable format for documenting requirements that can be easily version-controlled and reviewed.

**Tags:** parsing, markdown, documentation

**Needs:** req, dsn

---

## feat~requirement-linking~1

**Title:** Link requirements to implementations and tests

**Description:** The system shall be able to automatically link requirements to their implementations and tests by analyzing coverage relationships.

**Rationale:** Automated linking ensures that all requirements are properly covered and helps identify orphaned or uncovered requirements.

**Tags:** linking, coverage, analysis

**Needs:** req, dsn

---

## feat~html-reporting~1

**Title:** Generate HTML tracing reports

**Description:** The system shall generate comprehensive HTML reports showing requirement coverage, defects, and traceability matrices.

**Rationale:** HTML reports provide an accessible way to visualize and share requirements tracing results with stakeholders.

**Tags:** reporting, html, visualization

**Needs:** req, dsn

---

## feat~build-integration~1

**Title:** Simple build.rs integration

**Description:** The system shall provide a simple API that can be easily integrated into Rust build.rs files for automated requirements checking.

**Rationale:** Build-time integration ensures that requirements tracing is part of the regular build process and prevents incomplete tracing from being committed.

**Tags:** integration, build, automation

**Needs:** req, dsn

---

## feat~error-handling~1

**Title:** Comprehensive error handling and reporting

**Description:** The system shall provide clear, actionable error messages when parsing fails or requirements tracing issues are detected.

**Rationale:** Good error handling helps developers quickly identify and fix requirements tracing issues.

**Tags:** error-handling, usability

**Needs:** req, dsn
